Simple 2-player Tank game made with node.js using express and socket.io.

Firstly the server.js file must be started in node, this can be executed by using the "node server.js" command within the correct directory.
After this you will be able to access the game through a browser on port 3001 using either "localhost:3001" or the host's ip on port 3001.

After opening the game each client will have a start button, after this is clicked will start the game.
Tank movement is executed by using WASD
