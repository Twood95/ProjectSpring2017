# ProjectSpring2017

Simple 2-player Tank game made with node.js using express and socket.io along with p5.js and p5.play javascript libraries.

Firstly the server.js file must be started in node, this can be executed by using the "node server.js" command within the correct directory.
After this you will be able to access the game through a browser on port 3001 using either "localhost:3001" or the host's ip on port 3001.

After opening the game each client will have a start button, after this is clicked will start the game.
Tank movement is executed by using WASD
Firing at another tank is performed by using the left mouse button.

I learned a lot about server and client programming in this project, and the amounts of communication that must be preformed between the two to keep them running and updating smoothly.

This game could benefit from future serverside updates to preform more checks to keep interactions consistent on both clients.
